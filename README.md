# AI Stethoscope System

An AI-powered stethoscope system designed to assist in heart and lung sound analysis.  
This project is developed as part of a Computer Engineering thesis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI Stethoscope system captures heart and lung sounds, processes them using machine learning models, and displays analysis results through a user-friendly interface.

The system is composed of:
- A **frontend** for visualization and user interaction
- A **backend** for data handling and AI integration
- AI models for heart murmur and lung sound detection (crackles / wheezes)
